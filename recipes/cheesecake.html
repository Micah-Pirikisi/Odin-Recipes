    <p>Cheesecake is a rich and creamy dessert that typically consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese, eggs, and sugar on a crust made from crushed cookies or graham crackers. It can be flavored with various ingredients such as vanilla, chocolate, or fruit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>4 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Fresh fruit or fruit sauce for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Mix in the sour cream and flour until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheesecake batter over the crust in the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 55-70 minutes, or until the center is almost set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly open for about an hour to cool gradually.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Before serving, you can top the cheesecake with fresh fruit or fruit sauce if desired. Slice and enjoy!</li>
