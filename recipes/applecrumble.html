        <p>Apple crumble is a classic dessert that features tender, spiced apples topped with a buttery, crumbly mixture. It's often served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups peeled and sliced apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work well)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (cold and cut into small pieces)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Spread the apple mixture evenly in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine the flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apples in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream if desired!</li>
